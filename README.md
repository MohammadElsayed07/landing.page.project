1. Edit HTML file, add new section.

2. Building NavBar Using createNav() function that executed by foreach loop and other helping methods to create elements and insert text to it and also appending.

3. Working on scroll Behavior of page by using EventListener method to make the scroll smooth between sections.

4. Adding Function using if statement and getBoundingClientRect Method to identify which section is on the viewport to give it a special class to be clearly viewed to the user that this is the actual section he wants, also it gives an active class to the Section button in the NavBar to be more clear what's the actual section the user selected.

5. Edit Css file, add active button.
